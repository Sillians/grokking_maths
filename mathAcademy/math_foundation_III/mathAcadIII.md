## **Implicit Differentiatione**  

Implicit differentiation is a technique used to find the derivative of a function when **it is not explicitly solved for one variable in terms of another**. 
This is especially useful for equations where **solving for y in terms of x is difficult or impossible**.  

#### **üîπ When to Use Implicit Differentiation?**  
- When a function is **not given explicitly** as \( y = f(x) \).  
- When it's easier to differentiate **both sides of the equation** rather than solving for \( y \).  
- When working with curves like **circles, ellipses, or complex equations**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Concept: Differentiating Both Sides**
Given an equation involving **both \( x \) and \( y \)**, apply **differentiation to both sides**, treating \( y \) as an **implicit function of \( x \)**.  

- **Differentiate \( x \) normally.**  
- **Differentiate \( y \) using the Chain Rule**, multiplying by \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) (since \( y \) is a function of \( x \)).  

#### **Example 1: Differentiating \( x^2 + y^2 = 25 \)**  
1. Differentiate both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} (x^2 + y^2) = \frac{d}{dx} (25)
   \]
2. Apply derivatives:  
   \[
   2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
   \]
3. Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):  
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}
   \]  

This is the derivative of a **circle** \( x^2 + y^2 = 25 \).

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Chain Rule in Implicit Differentiation**
Since \( y \) is **implicitly defined**, we apply the **chain rule** whenever differentiating a term involving \( y \).  

#### **Example 2: Differentiating \( x^3 + y^3 = 9xy \)**  
1. Differentiate both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} (x^3) + \frac{d}{dx} (y^3) = \frac{d}{dx} (9xy)
   \]
2. Apply derivatives:
   \[
   3x^2 + 3y^2 \frac{dy}{dx} = 9 \left( x \frac{dy}{dx} + y \right)
   \]
3. Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):  
   \[
   3y^2 \frac{dy}{dx} - 9x \frac{dy}{dx} = 9y - 3x^2
   \]
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} (3y^2 - 9x) = 9y - 3x^2
   \]
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{9y - 3x^2}{3y^2 - 9x}
   \]

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Higher-Order Implicit Differentiation**
For second derivatives (\( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \)), differentiate implicitly **again**.

#### **Example 3: Finding \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \) for \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \)**  
1. First derivative:  
   \[
   2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
   \]
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}
   \]
2. Differentiate again using the **quotient rule**:  
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} \left( -\frac{x}{y} \right)
   \]
   Using the quotient rule:
   \[
   \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -\frac{y(1) - x\frac{dy}{dx}}{y^2}
   \]
   Substituting \( \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y} \),
   \[
   \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -\frac{y - x(-x/y)}{y^2}
   \]
   \[
   = -\frac{y + x^2/y}{y^2}
   \]
   \[
   = -\frac{y^2 + x^2}{y^3}
   \]

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Applications of Implicit Differentiation**
- **Tangents & Normals to Curves:**  
  - Find slopes of curves without solving explicitly for \( y \).  
- **Physics & Related Rates:**  
  - Problems involving motion (e.g., **circle expansion, volume changes**).  
- **Curvature & Second Derivatives:**  
  - Helps compute **concavity and inflection points**.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Summary**
‚úÖ Differentiate both sides while treating \( y \) as a function of \( x \).  
‚úÖ Use the **chain rule** when differentiating terms involving \( y \).  
‚úÖ Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) explicitly.  
‚úÖ For second derivatives, differentiate **implicitly again**.  

Implicit differentiation is a **powerful tool** for handling equations where solving for \( y \) is difficult, 
making it essential in **calculus, physics, and engineering**.
