## Mathematical Foundations I






## The isosceles Triangle Theorem
Remember that longer sides in a triangle are opposite to larger angles, and vice versa. But what if two (or more) sides have the same length?

As you might have guessed, if two sides have the same length, then the opposite angles have the same measure. And vice-versa: if two angles have the same measure, then the opposite sides have the same length.

So, we obtain the following important properties of isosceles and equilateral triangles:

- A triangle is equilateral if and only if all of its angles are of $60^o$.
- A triangle is isosceles if and only if it has exactly two congruent angles.

The isosceles triangle theorem:
- If a triangle is isosceles, then the base angles are congruent.

The converse isosceles triangle theorem:
- If two angles in a triangle have the same measure, then the triangle must be isosceles.

The internal angles of any triangle sum to $180^o$


## Introduction to Elimination Method

`Systems of Linear Equation`
The elimination method is one of the techniques to solve the system of linear equations. In this method, either add or subtract the equations to get the equation in one variable. If the coefficients of one of the variables are the same, and the sign of the coefficients are opposite, we can add the equation to eliminate the variable. Similarly, if the coefficients of one of the variables are the same, and the sign of the coefficients are the same, we can subtract the equation to get the equation in one variable.

In case, if we do not have the equation to directly add or subtract the equations to eliminate the variable, you can begin by multiplying one or both the equations by a constant value on both sides of an equation to obtain the equivalent linear system of equations and then eliminate the variable by simply adding or subtracting equations.

`Elimination Method Steps:`

- **Step 1**: Firstly, multiply both the given equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make the coefficients of any one of the variables (either x or y) numerically equal.

- **Step 2**: After that, add or subtract one equation from the other in such a way that one variable gets eliminated. 
Now, if you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3. Else;

If we obtain a true statement including no variable, then the original pair of equations has infinitely many solutions.
If we obtain a false statement including no variable, then the original pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent.

- **Step 3**: Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) to get its value.

- **Step 4**: Substitute this value in any of the given equations to get the value of another variable


## Introduction to Functions

A function is a rule that takes a number as input and then outputs another number. A function is defined as a relation between a set of inputs having one output each. In simple words, a function is a relationship between inputs where each input is related to exactly one output. Every function has a domain and codomain or range. 
A function is generally denoted by $f(x)$ where $x$ is the input.

For instance, let's look at the following function:

$`f(x) = 3x + 1`$

In this example,

- $f$ is the name of the function,
- the number $x$ is the input,
- the number $`3x + 1`$ is the output.



## Equations of Lines in Slope Intercept

The slope intercept formula $`y = mx + b`$ is used when you know the slope of the line to be examined and the point given is also the $y$ intercept (0, b). 
In the formula, $b$ represents the $y$ value of the $y$ intercept point.

To determine the equation of a line, you may use two variations of the general form of a line.

These formulas are:

- The Point-Slope Formula:  $`(y – y_{1}) = m(x – x_{1})`$

- we calculate the slope $m$ using the given points: $`m = \frac {(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - X_1)}`$

- The Slope-Intercept Formula: $`y = mx + b`$


The **x-intercept** is the point where a line or curve crosses the x-axis. At this point, the \(y\)-coordinate is always \(0\). To find the x-intercept, set \(y = 0\) in the equation of the line or curve and solve for \(x\).



---
## For a Linear Equation:
The general form of a linear equation is:

$`y = mx + b`$

Set $y = 0$:

$`0 = mx + b`$

Solve for $x$:

$`x = -\frac{b}{m}`$

The x-intercept is $`(-b/m, 0)`$.


### Example:
For the equation $`y = 3x - 6`$:
1. Set $y = 0$:
   $`0 = 3x - 6`$

2. Solve for $x$:
   $`x = \frac{6}{3} = 2`$

The x-intercept is:
$`(2, 0)`$

## Congruent Polygons
Two polygons are congruent if they have the same shape. This means that

- they have the same number of sides,
- all corresponding sides are congruent, and
- all corresponding interior angles are congruent.


## Rules of Absolute Value
Absolute value represents the distance of a number from 0 on the number line, regardless of direction. It is always non-negative.

#### **Notation**
The absolute value of $x$ is written as $`|x|`$.

#### **Rules for Computation**
1. **If $`x \geq 0`$:**
   
   $`|x| = x`$

2. **If $x < 0$:**
   
   $`|x| = -x`$

   (The negative sign makes it positive.)


#### **Examples**
1. $|5| = 5$ (positive remains unchanged).
2. $|-3| = 3$ (negative becomes positive).
3. $|0| = 0$ (zero is its own absolute value).


#### **Properties of Absolute Value**
1. **Non-Negativity:** $`|x| \geq 0`$.
2. **Identity Property:** $`|x| = 0`$ if and only if $x = 0$.
3. **Multiplicative Property:** $`|ab| = |a| \cdot |b|`$.
4. **Triangle Inequality:** $`|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|`$.


#### **Applications**
1. **Solving Absolute Value Equations:**
   - Example: Solve $`|x - 2| = 5`$.
     - Case 1: $`x - 2 = 5`$ → $x = 7$.
     - Case 2: $`x - 2 = -5`$ → $x = -3$.

2. **Solving Absolute Value Inequalities:**
   - Example: Solve $`|x - 3| \leq 4`$.
     - Rewrite as $`-4 \leq x - 3 \leq 4`$.
     - Solve: $`-1 \leq x \leq 7`$.

## Area of a Triangle
The **area of a triangle** can be computed using the formula:

$`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}`$

### Explanation:
- The **base** is any side of the triangle.
- The **height** (or altitude) is the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to the base.

### Other Formulas:
1. **Using Heron's Formula** (when all three sides $a, b, c$ are known):
   
    $`\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}`$

   where $`s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}`$ is the semi-perimeter.

2. **Using Trigonometry** (when two sides and the included angle are known):
   $`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \times \sin(C)`$

   where $a$ and $b$ are two sides, and $C$ is the angle between them.

### Example:
1. If the base is $10$ units and the height is $6$ units:

   $`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 6 = 30 \, \text{square units}.`$

2. If the sides of the triangle are $a = 7$, $b = 8$, and $c = 9$:

   $`s = \frac{7+8+9}{2} = 12`$

   $`\text{Area} = \sqrt{12(12-7)(12-8)(12-9)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{720} \approx 26.83 \, \text{square units}.`$



---
## Area of a Trapezoid
The **area of a trapezoid** can be computed using the formula:

$`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (b_1 + b_2) \cdot h`$

### Explanation:
- $b_1$: Length of the first (top) base.
- $b_2$: Length of the second (bottom) base.
- $h$: Height (the perpendicular distance between the two bases).


### Example:
A trapezoid has bases $`b_1 = 8 {cm}`$, $`b_2 = 12 {cm}`$, and height $`h = 5 {cm}`$.

Using the formula:
$`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (8 + 12) \cdot 5`$

$`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \cdot 5 = 50 \, \text{cm}^2`$

The area of the trapezoid is $`50 {cm}^2`$.


---
## Area of a Parallelogram
The **area of a parallelogram** is calculated using the formula:

$`\text{Area} = b \cdot h`$

### Explanation:
- $b$: The length of the base.
- $h$: The perpendicular height (the shortest distance from the base to the opposite side).


### Example:
A parallelogram has a base of $`b = 10 {cm}`$ and a height of $`h = 6 {cm}`$.

Using the formula:

$`\text{Area} = 10 \cdot 6 = 60 \, \text{cm}^2`$

The area of the parallelogram is $`60 {cm}^2`$.


## Exponential Decay Function
The general expression for **exponential decay** is:

$`y(t) = y_0 e^{-kt}`$

### Where:
- $y(t)$: the quantity at time $t$,
- $y_0$: the initial quantity $`at ( t = 0 )`$,
- $k > 0$: the decay constant (rate of decay),
- $e$: the base of the natural logarithm ($`\approx 2.718`$),
- $t$: time.

### Key Points:
- **Exponential decay** describes processes where the quantity decreases over time at a rate proportional to its current value.
- Common examples include radioactive decay, depreciation, and cooling. 


---
## Area of a Circle
The **area of a circle** is given by the formula:

$`A = \pi r^2`$

### Where:
- $A$: Area of the circle,
- $r$: Radius of the circle,
- $\pi$: A constant approximately equal to $3.14159$.

### Key Notes:
1. The radius $( r )$ is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference.
2. If the diameter $( d )$ is known instead, the radius can be found as $`r = \frac{d}{2}`$.
3. Always ensure $r$ is in the same unit as the desired area for consistency.


## Area of a composite polygon
The **area of a composite polygon** can be found by dividing the polygon into simpler shapes (like rectangles, triangles, circles, or trapezoids), 
calculating the area of each shape, and then summing or subtracting these areas as necessary.

### Steps to Find the Area:
1. **Divide the Polygon**:
   Break the composite polygon into smaller, manageable shapes (triangles, rectangles, etc.).
   
2. **Calculate Each Area**:
   Use the appropriate formula for each shape:
   - Triangle: $`A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}`$
   - Rectangle: $`A = \text{length} \cdot \text{width}`$
   - Trapezoid: $`A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (\text{base}_1 + \text{base}_2) \cdot \text{height}`$
   - Circle segment (if applicable): $`A = \pi r^2 \cdot \frac{\theta}{360^\circ}`$

3. **Sum or Subtract Areas**:
   - Add the areas of all the parts that make up the polygon.
   - Subtract the areas of any internal holes or gaps.

4. **Combine the Results**:
   Ensure all areas are in the same unit before summing.

### Example:
For a composite polygon shaped like an "L":
- Divide it into two rectangles.
- Calculate the area of each rectangle using $`A = \text{length} \cdot \text{width}`$.
- Add the two areas together.

This systematic approach works for any composite polygon.



## Perimeter of a composite polygon
The **perimeter of a composite polygon** is the sum of the lengths of all its outer sides.

### Steps to Calculate the Perimeter:
1. **Identify the Outer Edges**:
   - Locate all the edges that form the outer boundary of the composite polygon. Exclude any internal edges or shared sides within the shape.

2. **Measure or Calculate Each Side**:
   - If side lengths are given, list them.
   - If not, use geometry or the distance formula $`d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}`$ for sides on a coordinate plane.

3. **Sum the Lengths**:
   - Add the lengths of all the identified outer edges.

### Example:
For an "L"-shaped composite polygon:
- Identify all the outer sides of the "L" (ignore the internal shared side).
- Suppose the side lengths are 4 m, 3 m, 2 m, 3 m, 2 m, and 4 m.
- Add them: $`4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 18, {m}`$.

Thus, the **perimeter** of the composite polygon is the total length of its boundary.


## Speed of a moving Object
The **speed** of a moving object is calculated as the distance traveled divided by the time it takes to travel 
that distance. The formula for speed is:

$`\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}`$

### Units:
- Speed is typically measured in units like meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h), 
or miles per hour (mph).

### Example:
If an object travels 120 kilometers in 2 hours, the speed is:

$`\text{Speed} = \frac{120 \, \text{km}}{2 \, \text{hours}} = 60 \, \text{km/h}.`$

### Key Notes:
- Speed is a scalar quantity (it has magnitude only).
- If direction is included, it becomes **velocity**, a vector quantity.


### Graphing a Piecewise Step Function

A **piecewise step function** is a type of function that is defined by different constant values over different intervals of the domain. These intervals are often indicated using inequalities.

---

### Steps to Graph a Piecewise Step Function:

1. **Understand the Definition**:
   A step function is typically written in the form:
   
   $`f(x) = \begin{cases} c_1, & a_1 \leq x < a_2 \\ c_2, & a_2 \leq x < a_3 \\ \vdots & \vdots \\ c_n, & a_{n-1} \leq x \leq a_n  \end{cases}`$

   Here, $`c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n`$ are constants, and $`a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n`$ define the intervals.

2. **Break Down the Domain**:
   Divide the $x$-axis into intervals based on the given piecewise definition.

3. **Plot Constant Values**:
   For each interval:
   - Plot a horizontal line at the corresponding constant $c_i$ value.
   - Use **open circles** to indicate excluded endpoints and **closed circles** for included endpoints.

4. **Connect or Break Steps**:
   Steps are generally disconnected because the function jumps from one value to another at the interval boundaries.

5. **Mark Key Points**:
   Clearly label the domain boundaries where the steps change, and ensure that each interval is properly represented.

---

### Example: 
Graph the step function:
$`f(x) = \begin{cases} 2, & 0 \leq x < 2 \\ 5, & 2 \leq x < 4 \\ -1, & 4 \leq x \leq 5  \end{cases}`$

- **Interval 1**: From $x = 0$ to $x = 2$, $f(x) = 2$. Plot a horizontal line at $y = 2$ with a closed circle at $x = 0$ and an open circle at $x = 2$.
- **Interval 2**: From $x = 2$ to $x = 4$, $f(x) = 5$. Plot a horizontal line at $y = 5$ with a closed circle at $x = 2$ and an open circle at $x = 4$.
- **Interval 3**: From $x = 4$ to $x = 5$, $f(x) = -1$. Plot a horizontal line at $y = -1$ with a closed circle at $x = 4$ and $x = 5$.

---

### Key Graph Features:
- Discrete jumps (no diagonal connections between steps).
- Open and closed circles represent inclusivity/exclusivity at boundaries.
- Each step is constant across its interval.


## The Quotient Rule for Radicals
The **Quotient Rule for Radicals** states that the square root of a quotient is equal to the quotient of the square roots, provided the denominator is not zero.

### Rule:

$`\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}, \quad b \neq 0`$

### Example 1:
Simplify $`\sqrt{\frac{16}{25}}`$:

$`\sqrt{\frac{16}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{16}}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{4}{5}.`$

### Generalization for Other Roots:
For any $n-th$ root:

$`\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}}, \quad b \neq 0.`$

### Important Notes:
- This rule applies to non-negative values of $a$ and $b$ when working with real numbers.
- If negative values are included, ensure the result is defined in the real number system (e.g., square roots of negative numbers are not real).




## Constant of Proportionality
The **constant of proportionality** is a constant value that relates two variables in a proportional relationship. 

### Types of Proportionality:

1. **Direct Proportionality**:
   - Two variables $x$ and $y$ are directly proportional if:
   
     $y = kx$
   
     where $k$ is the constant of proportionality.
   - Example: If $`y = 5x`$, then $k = 5$.

2. **Inverse Proportionality**:
   - Two variables $x$ and $y$ are inversely proportional if:
     
     $y = \frac{k}{x}$
     
     where $k$ is the constant of proportionality.
   - Example: If $`y = \frac{12}{x}`$, then $k = 12$.

### How to Find $k$:
To determine the constant of proportionality:
- For direct proportionality: Divide $y$ by $x$: 
  
  $k = \frac{y}{x}$

- For inverse proportionality: Multiply $x$ and $y$: 
  
  $k = xy$

### Applications:
The constant of proportionality is widely used in:
- Physics (e.g., Hooke's Law: ($`F = kx`$).
- Economics (e.g., supply and demand relationships).
- Mathematics (e.g., slope of a line in a direct variation).



## Direct variation equation
To write a **direct variation equation** from a graph, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Recognize the Form of Direct Variation**
A direct variation equation is of the form:

$y = kx$

where:
- $k$ is the constant of proportionality (or slope).
- The graph of the equation passes through the origin $(0, 0)$.

---

### 2. **Pick a Point on the Graph**
Choose any point $(x, y)$ on the graph (other than $(0, 0))$.

---

### 3. **Calculate the Constant $k$**
The constant $k$ is the ratio of $y$ to $x$:

$`k = \frac{y}{x}`$

---

### 4. **Write the Equation**
Substitute the value of $k$ into the equation $y = kx$.

---

### Example
Suppose the graph passes through $(2, 6)$. 

1. The direct variation equation is of the form $y = kx$.
2. Using the point $(2, 6)$, calculate $k$:
   
   $`k = \frac{6}{2} = 3`$

3. The equation is:
   $y = 3x$

---

### Verification
Check if other points on the graph satisfy $y = 3x$. For example, $(4, 12)$:
$y = 3(4) = 12$

The equation holds true.



## Pythagorean Theorem
The **Pythagorean Theorem** is a fundamental principle in geometry that applies to right-angled triangles. It states:

$`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`$

Where:
- $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two legs (sides forming the right angle),
- $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

---

### Applications:
1. **Find the Hypotenuse**:
   If $a = 3$ and $b = 4$, then:
   $`c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5`$


2. **Find a Leg**:
   If $c = 10$ and $a = 6$, then:
   $`b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2} = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64} = 8`$

---

### Key Points:
- Only applies to right-angled triangles.
- Useful for calculating distances in coordinate geometry.
- Forms the basis of many geometric and algebraic concepts.



## Calculating Acceleration from a Speed-Time Graph

Acceleration is the **rate of change of velocity with respect to time**. When working with a speed-time graph, the acceleration can be determined from the **slope** of the graph.

---

### Formula:
$`a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}`$

Where:
- $a$ = acceleration $(m/s²)$,
- $\Delta v$ = change in speed (final speed $v_f$ minus initial speed $v_i$) in m/s,
- $`\Delta t`$ = change in time (final time $t_f$ minus initial time $t_i$) in seconds.

---

### Steps:
1. Identify two points on the speed-time graph.
   - Point 1: $`(t_1, v_1)`$,
   - Point 2: $`(t_2, v_2)`$.

2. Use the formula for the slope:
   $`a = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1}`$

3. Interpret the slope:
   - Positive slope = Positive acceleration (speeding up),
   - Negative slope = Negative acceleration (slowing down, also called deceleration),
   - Zero slope = No acceleration (constant speed).

---

### Example:
Given the following points from a speed-time graph:
- At $`t = 2 {s}, v = 4 {m/s}`$,
- At $`t = 6{s}, v = 12{m/s}`$,

Calculate acceleration:
$`a = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{12 - 4}{6 - 2} = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \, \text{m/s}^2`$

The acceleration is $`2 {m/s}^2`$.

---

### Key Points:
- The slope of the graph gives the acceleration.
- Acceleration is uniform if the slope is constant.
- Curved graphs indicate non-uniform acceleration, requiring calculus for precise values.



## 30-60-90 triangle
A **30-60-90 triangle** is a special right triangle with angles of $30^\circ$, $60^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. 
Its side lengths have a consistent ratio: 

$`1 : \sqrt{3} : 2`$

This ratio corresponds to:
- The side opposite the $30^\circ$ angle (shortest side) = $x$,
- The side opposite the $60^\circ$ angle (longer leg) = $x\sqrt{3}$,
- The hypotenuse (opposite the $90^\circ$ angle) = $2x$.

### Calculations:
If given one side, the others can be found using the ratio:

1. **Given the hypotenuse $(h)$**:
   - Shortest side $`(x) = \frac{h}{2}`$,
   - Longer leg = $`x\sqrt{3} = \frac{h\sqrt{3}}{2}`$.

2. **Given the shorter leg $(x)$**:
   - Hypotenuse = $2x$,
   - Longer leg = $`x\sqrt{3}`$.

3. **Given the longer leg $(l)$**:
   - Shortest side = $`\frac{l}{\sqrt{3}}`$,
   - Hypotenuse = $`2 \times \frac{l}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2l}{\sqrt{3}}`$.

### Example:
If the shortest side $(x) = 5$:
- Hypotenuse = $2 \times 5 = 10$,
- Longer leg = $5\sqrt{3} \approx 8.66$.

This consistent ratio makes the 30-60-90 triangle simple to work with.



## linear equations with unknown coefficients by factoring
To solve **linear equations with unknown coefficients by factoring**, follow these steps:

### Example Equation:
$`ax + b = 0`$

### Steps:
1. **Isolate the linear term:**
   Move constants to the other side:
   $`ax = -b`$

2. **Factor out the coefficient of \(x\):**
   If the coefficient $a$ is an unknown, treat it as a variable:
   
   $`x = -\frac{b}{a}`$

3. **Check constraints:**
   - Ensure $`a \neq 0`$, as division by zero is undefined.

### Extension to Factoring Multiple Linear Expressions:
If the equation is expressed in a factored form, such as:

$`(ax + b)(cx + d) = 0`$

Apply the **Zero Product Property**:

$`(ax + b) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (cx + d) = 0`$

Solve each:
1. From $`ax + b = 0`$:

   $`x = -\frac{b}{a}`$

2. From $`cx + d = 0`$:

   $`x = -\frac{d}{c}`$

The solutions are:

$`x = -\frac{b}{a} \quad \text{and} \quad x = -\frac{d}{c}`$

### Example:
Solve:
$`2x + 3 = 0`$

- Isolate $x$:
  $`2x = -3`$

- Solve for $x$:
  $`x = -\frac{3}{2}`$

If coefficients $a, b, c, d$ are not numeric, the steps are the same but retain the symbolic coefficients in the solution.



## Equations of Lines in Standard Form
The **standard form of the equation of a line** is expressed as:

$`Ax + By = C`$

Where:
- $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers (preferably with $`A \geq 0`$).
- $A$ and $B$ are not both zero $`((A, B) \neq (0, 0))`$.

### Steps to Write a Line in Standard Form:
1. Rearrange the given equation to move $x$- and $$-terms to the left side.
2. Ensure coefficients are integers by multiplying through by an appropriate factor if fractions are present.
3. Normalize the equation (e.g., ensure $A$ is positive).

---

### Example 1: Convert $y = 3x + 5$ to Standard Form
1. Rearrange terms:
   $`-3x + y = 5`$

2. Multiply by $-1$ to make $A$ positive:
   
   $`3x - y = -5`$

### Example 2: Convert $`y = \frac{1}{2}x - 4`$ to Standard Form
1. Eliminate the fraction by multiplying through by 2:
   $`2y = x - 8`$

2. Rearrange terms:
   $`-x + 2y = -8`$

3. Multiply by $-1$ to ensure $A > 0$:
   $`x - 2y = 8`$

### Key Notes:
- **Slope $(m)$**: Can be derived from standard form as $`m = -\frac{A}{B}`$.
- **Y-intercept $(c)$**: Can be derived as $`c = \frac{C}{B}`$.
