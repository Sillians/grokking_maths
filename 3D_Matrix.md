# Fundamental Concept of 3D Matrices

### Basic Definitions and some Inequalities for 3-D Matrices
A `3D matrix` is an extension of a traditional `2D` matrix with an added third dimension. You can think of it as a collection of `2D matrices` (or layers)
stacked together. A `3D` matrix can be represented as a matrix with three indices, often denoted as $A[i][j][k]$, where:
- $i$: Specifies the layer (or depth),
- $j$: Specifies the row,
- $k$: Specifies the column.

This structure allows us to represent more complex data, such as color images or volumes, and is commonly used in fields like image processing, physics,
and machine learning.

**Example:**

Consider a `3D` matrix $A$ of dimensions $2 x 2 x 3$. This means we have `2 layers` (or depth), each containing a `2x3` matrix.

```math
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{111} & a_{112} & a_{113} \\
a_{121} & a_{122} & a_{123} \\
\end{bmatrix},
\quad
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{211} & a_{212} & a_{213} \\
a_{221} & a_{222} & a_{223} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{bmatrix}
```


In this matrix:

- **Layer 1** (or $i=1$) is:
```math
  \begin{bmatrix}
  a_{111} & a_{112} & a_{113} \\
  a_{121} & a_{122} & a_{123} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
```


- **Layer 2** (or $i=2$) is:
```math
  \begin{bmatrix}
  a_{211} & a_{212} & a_{213} \\
  a_{221} & a_{222} & a_{223} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
```


**Notations:**

The notation 
```math
A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times m \times s}
``` 
typically represents a **3D complex matrix** with dimensions $m \times m \times s$ where $\mathbb{C}$ denotes the set of complex numbers. Hereâ€™s what each part means:

- $\mathbb{C}$: Indicates that the elements of $A$ are complex numbers.
- $m \times m$: Represents the number of rows and columns in each `2D` matrix "slice" of $A$.
- $s$: Represents the number of such 2D slices or layers in the third dimension.

In other words, $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times m \times s}$ means that $A$ is a **3D array of complex numbers** with $s$ matrices, 
each of which has $m$ rows and $m$ columns.


A `3D` maatrix can be written in as 
```math
A = \bigcup_{k=1}^s A_k$ 
```

means that $A$ is the **union** of the sets $A_{k}$ from $k = 1$ to $s$. Each $A_{k}$ is a subset or component
of the set $A$, and the union symbol $\cup$ indicates that $A$ includes all elements from each $A_{k}$.


In words, this notation describes $A$ as being composed of the elements in $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_s$.

- $A_k$ refers to each 2D "slice" or layer in the `3D` matrix.
- Thus, $A$ as the union of $A_k$ would mean that it consists of all these slices combined to form the entire structure.


In general, the `3D` matrix $A = \bigcup_{k=1}^s A_k$ is used when you want to express that $A$ is made up of distinct parts, subsets, 
or layers labeled from $A_1$ to $A_s$.



### Basic Definitions for 3-D Matrices
- **Determinant Vector:** Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times m \times s}$ be a `3-D` matrix and $det(A^{k})$ be the determinant of the $k^{th}$ section of $A$.
The vector $det(A) \in \mathbb{C}^{1 \times 1 \times s}$ is called the determinant vector of the 3-dimensional matrix $A$ whose entries are
$det(A^{k})$, where $k = 1,...,s$.


- **Singular and Abstract Singular Matrix:** A 3-dimensional matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times m \times s}$ is said to be singular if $det(A^{k})$ = 0 for all
$k = 1,...,s$. On the other hand, the matrix $A$ is called almost singular if $det(A^{k})$ = 0 for countable $k$.


- **Identity Matrix:** Let $I \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times m \times s}$ be a 3-dimensional matrix whose entries, for all $k$, are $a^{k}_{ij} =  1$ whenever
$i = j$, and $a^{k}_{ij} =  0$ while $i \neq j$. Then the matrix $I$ is the 3-dimensional identity matrix.


- **Inverse Matrix:** Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times m \times s}$ be a 3-dimensional matrix. Then, $A^{-1}$ is called inverse matrix of $A$ when
$AA^{-1} = \bigcup_{k=1}^s (A^{k})(A^{k})^{-1} = I$ where $I$ is the 3-dimensional identity matrix.

- **Transpose:** Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times m \times s}$ be a 3-dimensional matrix and $A^{*} = \bigcup_{k=1}^s (A^{k})^{*}$. Then the matrix 
$A^{*} \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times m \times s} $ is called the conjugate transpose of the matrix $A$.

  

### Applications of 3D Matrices
3D matrices are particularly useful for:
- **Image Processing**: Representing color images, where each layer represents one color channel (e.g., red, green, and blue).
- **Medical Imaging**: Storing slices of 3D scans (like CT or MRI scans).
- **Machine Learning**: Feeding 3D data into neural networks, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where spatial data may be represented in 3D form.
