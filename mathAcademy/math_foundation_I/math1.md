## Mathematical Foundations I






## The isosceles Triangle Theorem
Remember that longer sides in a triangle are opposite to larger angles, and vice versa. But what if two (or more) sides have the same length?

As you might have guessed, if two sides have the same length, then the opposite angles have the same measure. And vice-versa: if two angles have the same measure, then the opposite sides have the same length.

So, we obtain the following important properties of isosceles and equilateral triangles:

- A triangle is equilateral if and only if all of its angles are of $60^o$.
- A triangle is isosceles if and only if it has exactly two congruent angles.

The isosceles triangle theorem:
- If a triangle is isosceles, then the base angles are congruent.

The converse isosceles triangle theorem:
- If two angles in a triangle have the same measure, then the triangle must be isosceles.

The internal angles of any triangle sum to $180^o$


## Introduction to Elimination Method

`Systems of Linear Equation`
The elimination method is one of the techniques to solve the system of linear equations. In this method, either add or subtract the equations to get the equation in one variable. If the coefficients of one of the variables are the same, and the sign of the coefficients are opposite, we can add the equation to eliminate the variable. Similarly, if the coefficients of one of the variables are the same, and the sign of the coefficients are the same, we can subtract the equation to get the equation in one variable.

In case, if we do not have the equation to directly add or subtract the equations to eliminate the variable, you can begin by multiplying one or both the equations by a constant value on both sides of an equation to obtain the equivalent linear system of equations and then eliminate the variable by simply adding or subtracting equations.

`Elimination Method Steps:`

- **Step 1**: Firstly, multiply both the given equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make the coefficients of any one of the variables (either x or y) numerically equal.

- **Step 2**: After that, add or subtract one equation from the other in such a way that one variable gets eliminated. 
Now, if you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3. Else;

If we obtain a true statement including no variable, then the original pair of equations has infinitely many solutions.
If we obtain a false statement including no variable, then the original pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent.

- **Step 3**: Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) to get its value.

- **Step 4**: Substitute this value in any of the given equations to get the value of another variable


## Introduction to Functions

A function is a rule that takes a number as input and then outputs another number. A function is defined as a relation between a set of inputs having one output each. In simple words, a function is a relationship between inputs where each input is related to exactly one output. Every function has a domain and codomain or range. 
A function is generally denoted by $f(x)$ where $x$ is the input.

For instance, let's look at the following function:

$`f(x) = 3x + 1`$

In this example,

- $f$ is the name of the function,
- the number $x$ is the input,
- the number $`3x + 1`$ is the output.



## Equations of Lines in Slope Intercept

The slope intercept formula $`y = mx + b`$ is used when you know the slope of the line to be examined and the point given is also the $y$ intercept (0, b). 
In the formula, $b$ represents the $y$ value of the $y$ intercept point.

To determine the equation of a line, you may use two variations of the general form of a line.

These formulas are:

- The Point-Slope Formula:  $`(y – y_{1}) = m(x – x_{1})`$

- we calculate the slope $m$ using the given points: $`m = \frac {(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - X_1)}`$

- The Slope-Intercept Formula: $`y = mx + b`$


The **x-intercept** is the point where a line or curve crosses the x-axis. At this point, the \(y\)-coordinate is always \(0\). To find the x-intercept, set \(y = 0\) in the equation of the line or curve and solve for \(x\).



---
## For a Linear Equation:
The general form of a linear equation is:

$`y = mx + b`$

Set $y = 0$:

$`0 = mx + b`$

Solve for $x$:

$`x = -\frac{b}{m}`$

The x-intercept is $`(-b/m, 0)`$.


### Example:
For the equation $`y = 3x - 6`$:
1. Set $y = 0$:
   $`0 = 3x - 6`$

2. Solve for $x$:
   $`x = \frac{6}{3} = 2`$

The x-intercept is:
$`(2, 0)`$

## Congruent Polygons
Two polygons are congruent if they have the same shape. This means that

- they have the same number of sides,
- all corresponding sides are congruent, and
- all corresponding interior angles are congruent.


## Rules of Absolute Value
Absolute value represents the distance of a number from 0 on the number line, regardless of direction. It is always non-negative.

#### **Notation**
The absolute value of $x$ is written as $`|x|`$.

#### **Rules for Computation**
1. **If $`x \geq 0`$:**
   
   $`|x| = x`$

2. **If $x < 0$:**
   
   $`|x| = -x`$

   (The negative sign makes it positive.)


#### **Examples**
1. $|5| = 5$ (positive remains unchanged).
2. $|-3| = 3$ (negative becomes positive).
3. $|0| = 0$ (zero is its own absolute value).


#### **Properties of Absolute Value**
1. **Non-Negativity:** $`|x| \geq 0`$.
2. **Identity Property:** $`|x| = 0`$ if and only if $x = 0$.
3. **Multiplicative Property:** $`|ab| = |a| \cdot |b|`$.
4. **Triangle Inequality:** $`|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|`$.


#### **Applications**
1. **Solving Absolute Value Equations:**
   - Example: Solve $`|x - 2| = 5`$.
     - Case 1: $`x - 2 = 5`$ → $x = 7$.
     - Case 2: $`x - 2 = -5`$ → $x = -3$.

2. **Solving Absolute Value Inequalities:**
   - Example: Solve $`|x - 3| \leq 4`$.
     - Rewrite as $`-4 \leq x - 3 \leq 4`$.
     - Solve: $`-1 \leq x \leq 7`$.

## Area of a Triangle
The **area of a triangle** can be computed using the formula:

$`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}`$

### Explanation:
- The **base** is any side of the triangle.
- The **height** (or altitude) is the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to the base.

### Other Formulas:
1. **Using Heron's Formula** (when all three sides $a, b, c$ are known):
   
    $`\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}`$

   where $`s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}`$ is the semi-perimeter.

2. **Using Trigonometry** (when two sides and the included angle are known):
   $`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \times \sin(C)`$

   where $a$ and $b$ are two sides, and $C$ is the angle between them.

### Example:
1. If the base is $10$ units and the height is $6$ units:

   $`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 6 = 30 \, \text{square units}.`$

2. If the sides of the triangle are $a = 7$, $b = 8$, and $c = 9$:

   $`s = \frac{7+8+9}{2} = 12`$

   $`\text{Area} = \sqrt{12(12-7)(12-8)(12-9)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{720} \approx 26.83 \, \text{square units}.`$



---
## Area of a Trapezoid
The **area of a trapezoid** can be computed using the formula:

$`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (b_1 + b_2) \cdot h`$

### Explanation:
- $b_1$: Length of the first (top) base.
- $b_2$: Length of the second (bottom) base.
- $h$: Height (the perpendicular distance between the two bases).


### Example:
A trapezoid has bases $`b_1 = 8 {cm}`$, $`b_2 = 12 {cm}`$, and height $`h = 5 {cm}`$.

Using the formula:
$`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (8 + 12) \cdot 5`$

$`\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \cdot 5 = 50 \, \text{cm}^2`$

The area of the trapezoid is $`50 {cm}^2`$.


---
## Area of a Parallelogram
The **area of a parallelogram** is calculated using the formula:

$`\text{Area} = b \cdot h`$

### Explanation:
- $b$: The length of the base.
- $h$: The perpendicular height (the shortest distance from the base to the opposite side).


### Example:
A parallelogram has a base of $`b = 10 {cm}`$ and a height of $`h = 6 {cm}`$.

Using the formula:

$`\text{Area} = 10 \cdot 6 = 60 \, \text{cm}^2`$

The area of the parallelogram is $`60 {cm}^2`$.


## Exponential Decay Function
The general expression for **exponential decay** is:

$`y(t) = y_0 e^{-kt}`$

### Where:
- $y(t)$: the quantity at time $t$,
- $y_0$: the initial quantity $`at ( t = 0 )`$,
- $k > 0$: the decay constant (rate of decay),
- $e$: the base of the natural logarithm ($`\approx 2.718`$),
- $t$: time.

### Key Points:
- **Exponential decay** describes processes where the quantity decreases over time at a rate proportional to its current value.
- Common examples include radioactive decay, depreciation, and cooling. 


---
## Area of a Circle
The **area of a circle** is given by the formula:

$`A = \pi r^2`$

### Where:
- $A$: Area of the circle,
- $r$: Radius of the circle,
- $\pi$: A constant approximately equal to $3.14159$.

### Key Notes:
1. The radius $( r )$ is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference.
2. If the diameter $( d )$ is known instead, the radius can be found as $`r = \frac{d}{2}`$.
3. Always ensure $r$ is in the same unit as the desired area for consistency.


## Area of a composite polygon
The **area of a composite polygon** can be found by dividing the polygon into simpler shapes (like rectangles, triangles, circles, or trapezoids), 
calculating the area of each shape, and then summing or subtracting these areas as necessary.

### Steps to Find the Area:
1. **Divide the Polygon**:
   Break the composite polygon into smaller, manageable shapes (triangles, rectangles, etc.).
   
2. **Calculate Each Area**:
   Use the appropriate formula for each shape:
   - Triangle: $`A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}`$
   - Rectangle: $`A = \text{length} \cdot \text{width}`$
   - Trapezoid: $`A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (\text{base}_1 + \text{base}_2) \cdot \text{height}`$
   - Circle segment (if applicable): $`A = \pi r^2 \cdot \frac{\theta}{360^\circ}`$

3. **Sum or Subtract Areas**:
   - Add the areas of all the parts that make up the polygon.
   - Subtract the areas of any internal holes or gaps.

4. **Combine the Results**:
   Ensure all areas are in the same unit before summing.

### Example:
For a composite polygon shaped like an "L":
- Divide it into two rectangles.
- Calculate the area of each rectangle using $`A = \text{length} \cdot \text{width}`$.
- Add the two areas together.

This systematic approach works for any composite polygon.



## Perimeter of a composite polygon
The **perimeter of a composite polygon** is the sum of the lengths of all its outer sides.

### Steps to Calculate the Perimeter:
1. **Identify the Outer Edges**:
   - Locate all the edges that form the outer boundary of the composite polygon. Exclude any internal edges or shared sides within the shape.

2. **Measure or Calculate Each Side**:
   - If side lengths are given, list them.
   - If not, use geometry or the distance formula $`d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}`$ for sides on a coordinate plane.

3. **Sum the Lengths**:
   - Add the lengths of all the identified outer edges.

### Example:
For an "L"-shaped composite polygon:
- Identify all the outer sides of the "L" (ignore the internal shared side).
- Suppose the side lengths are 4 m, 3 m, 2 m, 3 m, 2 m, and 4 m.
- Add them: $`4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 18, {m}`$.

Thus, the **perimeter** of the composite polygon is the total length of its boundary.


## Speed of a moving Object
The **speed** of a moving object is calculated as the distance traveled divided by the time it takes to travel 
that distance. The formula for speed is:

$`\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}`$

### Units:
- Speed is typically measured in units like meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h), 
or miles per hour (mph).

### Example:
If an object travels 120 kilometers in 2 hours, the speed is:

$`\text{Speed} = \frac{120 \, \text{km}}{2 \, \text{hours}} = 60 \, \text{km/h}.`$

### Key Notes:
- Speed is a scalar quantity (it has magnitude only).
- If direction is included, it becomes **velocity**, a vector quantity.


### Graphing a Piecewise Step Function

A **piecewise step function** is a type of function that is defined by different constant values over different intervals of the domain. These intervals are often indicated using inequalities.

---

### Steps to Graph a Piecewise Step Function:

1. **Understand the Definition**:
   A step function is typically written in the form:
   
   $`f(x) = \begin{cases} c_1, & a_1 \leq x < a_2 \\ c_2, & a_2 \leq x < a_3 \\ \vdots & \vdots \\ c_n, & a_{n-1} \leq x \leq a_n  \end{cases}`$

   Here, $`c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n`$ are constants, and $`a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n`$ define the intervals.

2. **Break Down the Domain**:
   Divide the $x$-axis into intervals based on the given piecewise definition.

3. **Plot Constant Values**:
   For each interval:
   - Plot a horizontal line at the corresponding constant $c_i$ value.
   - Use **open circles** to indicate excluded endpoints and **closed circles** for included endpoints.

4. **Connect or Break Steps**:
   Steps are generally disconnected because the function jumps from one value to another at the interval boundaries.

5. **Mark Key Points**:
   Clearly label the domain boundaries where the steps change, and ensure that each interval is properly represented.

---

### Example: 
Graph the step function:
$`f(x) = \begin{cases} 2, & 0 \leq x < 2 \\ 5, & 2 \leq x < 4 \\ -1, & 4 \leq x \leq 5  \end{cases}`$

- **Interval 1**: From $x = 0$ to $x = 2$, $f(x) = 2$. Plot a horizontal line at $y = 2$ with a closed circle at $x = 0$ and an open circle at $x = 2$.
- **Interval 2**: From $x = 2$ to $x = 4$, $f(x) = 5$. Plot a horizontal line at $y = 5$ with a closed circle at $x = 2$ and an open circle at $x = 4$.
- **Interval 3**: From $x = 4$ to $x = 5$, $f(x) = -1$. Plot a horizontal line at $y = -1$ with a closed circle at $x = 4$ and $x = 5$.

---

### Key Graph Features:
- Discrete jumps (no diagonal connections between steps).
- Open and closed circles represent inclusivity/exclusivity at boundaries.
- Each step is constant across its interval.


## The Quotient Rule for Radicals
The **Quotient Rule for Radicals** states that the square root of a quotient is equal to the quotient of the square roots, provided the denominator is not zero.

### Rule:

$`\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}, \quad b \neq 0`$

### Example 1:
Simplify $`\sqrt{\frac{16}{25}}`$:

$`\sqrt{\frac{16}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{16}}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{4}{5}.`$

### Generalization for Other Roots:
For any $n-th$ root:

$`\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}}, \quad b \neq 0.`$

### Important Notes:
- This rule applies to non-negative values of $a$ and $b$ when working with real numbers.
- If negative values are included, ensure the result is defined in the real number system (e.g., square roots of negative numbers are not real).




## Constant of Proportionality
The **constant of proportionality** is a constant value that relates two variables in a proportional relationship. 

### Types of Proportionality:

1. **Direct Proportionality**:
   - Two variables $x$ and $y$ are directly proportional if:
   
     $y = kx$
   
     where $k$ is the constant of proportionality.
   - Example: If $`y = 5x`$, then $k = 5$.

2. **Inverse Proportionality**:
   - Two variables $x$ and $y$ are inversely proportional if:
     
     $y = \frac{k}{x}$
     
     where $k$ is the constant of proportionality.
   - Example: If $`y = \frac{12}{x}`$, then $k = 12$.

### How to Find $k$:
To determine the constant of proportionality:
- For direct proportionality: Divide $y$ by $x$: 
  
  $k = \frac{y}{x}$

- For inverse proportionality: Multiply $x$ and $y$: 
  
  $k = xy$

### Applications:
The constant of proportionality is widely used in:
- Physics (e.g., Hooke's Law: ($`F = kx`$).
- Economics (e.g., supply and demand relationships).
- Mathematics (e.g., slope of a line in a direct variation).



## Direct variation equation
To write a **direct variation equation** from a graph, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Recognize the Form of Direct Variation**
A direct variation equation is of the form:

$y = kx$

where:
- $k$ is the constant of proportionality (or slope).
- The graph of the equation passes through the origin $(0, 0)$.

---

### 2. **Pick a Point on the Graph**
Choose any point $(x, y)$ on the graph (other than $(0, 0))$.

---

### 3. **Calculate the Constant $k$**
The constant $k$ is the ratio of $y$ to $x$:

$`k = \frac{y}{x}`$

---

### 4. **Write the Equation**
Substitute the value of $k$ into the equation $y = kx$.

---

### Example
Suppose the graph passes through $(2, 6)$. 

1. The direct variation equation is of the form $y = kx$.
2. Using the point $(2, 6)$, calculate $k$:
   
   $`k = \frac{6}{2} = 3`$

3. The equation is:
   $y = 3x$

---

### Verification
Check if other points on the graph satisfy $y = 3x$. For example, $(4, 12)$:
$y = 3(4) = 12$

The equation holds true.



## Pythagorean Theorem
The **Pythagorean Theorem** is a fundamental principle in geometry that applies to right-angled triangles. It states:

$`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`$

Where:
- $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two legs (sides forming the right angle),
- $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).

---

### Applications:
1. **Find the Hypotenuse**:
   If $a = 3$ and $b = 4$, then:
   $`c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5`$


2. **Find a Leg**:
   If $c = 10$ and $a = 6$, then:
   $`b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2} = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64} = 8`$

---

### Key Points:
- Only applies to right-angled triangles.
- Useful for calculating distances in coordinate geometry.
- Forms the basis of many geometric and algebraic concepts.



## Calculating Acceleration from a Speed-Time Graph

Acceleration is the **rate of change of velocity with respect to time**. When working with a speed-time graph, the acceleration can be determined from the **slope** of the graph.

---

### Formula:
$`a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}`$

Where:
- $a$ = acceleration $(m/s²)$,
- $\Delta v$ = change in speed (final speed $v_f$ minus initial speed $v_i$) in m/s,
- $`\Delta t`$ = change in time (final time $t_f$ minus initial time $t_i$) in seconds.

---

### Steps:
1. Identify two points on the speed-time graph.
   - Point 1: $`(t_1, v_1)`$,
   - Point 2: $`(t_2, v_2)`$.

2. Use the formula for the slope:
   $`a = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1}`$

3. Interpret the slope:
   - Positive slope = Positive acceleration (speeding up),
   - Negative slope = Negative acceleration (slowing down, also called deceleration),
   - Zero slope = No acceleration (constant speed).

---

### Example:
Given the following points from a speed-time graph:
- At $`t = 2 {s}, v = 4 {m/s}`$,
- At $`t = 6{s}, v = 12{m/s}`$,

Calculate acceleration:
$`a = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{12 - 4}{6 - 2} = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \, \text{m/s}^2`$

The acceleration is $`2 {m/s}^2`$.

---

### Key Points:
- The slope of the graph gives the acceleration.
- Acceleration is uniform if the slope is constant.
- Curved graphs indicate non-uniform acceleration, requiring calculus for precise values.



## 30-60-90 triangle
A **30-60-90 triangle** is a special right triangle with angles of $30^\circ$, $60^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. 
Its side lengths have a consistent ratio: 

$`1 : \sqrt{3} : 2`$

This ratio corresponds to:
- The side opposite the $30^\circ$ angle (shortest side) = $x$,
- The side opposite the $60^\circ$ angle (longer leg) = $x\sqrt{3}$,
- The hypotenuse (opposite the $90^\circ$ angle) = $2x$.

### Calculations:
If given one side, the others can be found using the ratio:

1. **Given the hypotenuse $(h)$**:
   - Shortest side $`(x) = \frac{h}{2}`$,
   - Longer leg = $`x\sqrt{3} = \frac{h\sqrt{3}}{2}`$.

2. **Given the shorter leg $(x)$**:
   - Hypotenuse = $2x$,
   - Longer leg = $`x\sqrt{3}`$.

3. **Given the longer leg $(l)$**:
   - Shortest side = $`\frac{l}{\sqrt{3}}`$,
   - Hypotenuse = $`2 \times \frac{l}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2l}{\sqrt{3}}`$.

### Example:
If the shortest side $(x) = 5$:
- Hypotenuse = $2 \times 5 = 10$,
- Longer leg = $5\sqrt{3} \approx 8.66$.

This consistent ratio makes the 30-60-90 triangle simple to work with.



## linear equations with unknown coefficients by factoring
To solve **linear equations with unknown coefficients by factoring**, follow these steps:

### Example Equation:
$`ax + b = 0`$

### Steps:
1. **Isolate the linear term:**
   Move constants to the other side:
   $`ax = -b`$

2. **Factor out the coefficient of \(x\):**
   If the coefficient $a$ is an unknown, treat it as a variable:
   
   $`x = -\frac{b}{a}`$

3. **Check constraints:**
   - Ensure $`a \neq 0`$, as division by zero is undefined.

### Extension to Factoring Multiple Linear Expressions:
If the equation is expressed in a factored form, such as:

$`(ax + b)(cx + d) = 0`$

Apply the **Zero Product Property**:

$`(ax + b) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (cx + d) = 0`$

Solve each:
1. From $`ax + b = 0`$:

   $`x = -\frac{b}{a}`$

2. From $`cx + d = 0`$:

   $`x = -\frac{d}{c}`$

The solutions are:

$`x = -\frac{b}{a} \quad \text{and} \quad x = -\frac{d}{c}`$

### Example:
Solve:
$`2x + 3 = 0`$

- Isolate $x$:
  $`2x = -3`$

- Solve for $x$:
  $`x = -\frac{3}{2}`$

If coefficients $a, b, c, d$ are not numeric, the steps are the same but retain the symbolic coefficients in the solution.



## Equations of Lines in Standard Form
The **standard form of the equation of a line** is expressed as:

$`Ax + By = C`$

Where:
- $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers (preferably with $`A \geq 0`$).
- $A$ and $B$ are not both zero $`((A, B) \neq (0, 0))`$.

### Steps to Write a Line in Standard Form:
1. Rearrange the given equation to move $x$- and $$-terms to the left side.
2. Ensure coefficients are integers by multiplying through by an appropriate factor if fractions are present.
3. Normalize the equation (e.g., ensure $A$ is positive).

---

### Example 1: Convert $y = 3x + 5$ to Standard Form
1. Rearrange terms:
   $`-3x + y = 5`$

2. Multiply by $-1$ to make $A$ positive:
   
   $`3x - y = -5`$

### Example 2: Convert $`y = \frac{1}{2}x - 4`$ to Standard Form
1. Eliminate the fraction by multiplying through by 2:
   $`2y = x - 8`$

2. Rearrange terms:
   $`-x + 2y = -8`$

3. Multiply by $-1$ to ensure $A > 0$:
   $`x - 2y = 8`$

### Key Notes:
- **Slope $(m)$**: Can be derived from standard form as $`m = -\frac{A}{B}`$.
- **Y-intercept $(c)$**: Can be derived as $`c = \frac{C}{B}`$.


## Solving equations with odd exponents using the Nth Root Method
To solve equations with **odd exponents** using the **Nth Root Method**, follow these steps:

### General Form:
The equation takes the form:

$x^n = a$

where:
- $n$ is an **odd integer** $`(n = 3, 5, 7, \dots)`$,
- $a$ is a real number.

### Steps:
1. **Apply the Nth Root:**
   Take the $n$-th root of both sides:
   
   $`x = \sqrt[n]{a}`$

   Since $n$ is odd, the root is unique and real for all real $a$.

2. **Simplify the Solution:**
   - If $a > 0$, $x > 0$.
   - If $a < 0$, $x < 0$.
   - If $a = 0$, $x = 0$.

---

### Example 1: Solve $`x^3 = 27`$
1. Take the cube root $`(n = 3)`$:
   
   $`x = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3`$

### Example 2: Solve $`x^5 = -32`$
1. Take the fifth root $`(n = 5)`$:
   
   $`x = \sqrt[5]{-32} = -2`$

---

### Key Notes:
1. **Odd Exponents and Negative Numbers:**
   Odd roots of negative numbers are defined. For example:
   
   $`\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2`$

   This is because $`(-2)^3 = -8`$.

2. **Contrast with Even Exponents:**
   For even $n$, negative $a$ leads to no real solution (e.g., $`x^2 = -1`$).

---

### Example 3: Solve $`3x^3 = 81`$
1. Isolate $x^3$:
   
   $`x^3 = \frac{81}{3} = 27`$

2. Take the cube root:
   
   $`x = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3`$

### Example 4: Solve $-2x^5 = -64$
1. Isolate $x^5$:
   
   $`x^5 = \frac{-64}{-2} = 32`$

2. Take the fifth root:
   
   $`x = \sqrt[5]{32} = 2`$

This method guarantees a unique real solution for equations with odd exponents.



## Constant of Variation
The **constant of variation** is a fixed value that describes the relationship between two variables in a proportional relationship. 
Depending on the type of variation, the constant governs how one variable changes in response to another.

---

### Types of Variation:

#### 1. **Direct Variation**
- When one variable increases or decreases directly with another, their relationship is:
  
  $y = kx$

  Where:
  - $k$: Constant of variation.
  - $x$: Independent variable.
  - $y$: Dependent variable.

**To find $k$**:

$k = \frac{y}{x}$

**Example**:
If $y = 12$ when $x = 4$, find $k$:

$`k = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{12}{4} = 3`$

---

#### 2. **Inverse Variation**
- When one variable increases as the other decreases, their relationship is:
  
  $`y = \frac{k}{x}`$

  Where:
  - $k$: Constant of variation.

**To find $k$**:

$`k = x \cdot y`$

**Example**:
If $y = 5$ when $x = 8$, find $k$:

$`k = x \cdot y = 8 \cdot 5 = 40`$

---

#### 3. **Joint Variation**
- When a variable depends on the product of two or more variables, the relationship is:
  
  $y = kxz$

  Where:
  - $k$: Constant of variation.
  - $x, z$: Independent variables.

**To find $k$**:

$`k = \frac{y}{xz}`$

**Example**:
If $y = 24$ when $x = 3$ and $z = 4$, find $k$:

$`k = \frac{y}{xz} = \frac{24}{3 \cdot 4} = 2`$

---

#### 4. **Combined Variation**
- Involves both direct and inverse variation:
  
  $`y = \frac{kx}{z}`$

  Where:
  - $y$ varies directly with $x$ and inversely with $z$.

**To find $k$**:

$`k = \frac{yz}{x}`$

**Example**:
If $y = 6$, $x = 2$, and $z = 4$, find $k$:

$`k = \frac{yz}{x} = \frac{6 \cdot 4}{2} = 12`$

---

### Key Points:
- The **constant of variation** $(k)$ remains unchanged for a given relationship, regardless of the specific values of the variables.
- Identifying the type of variation helps determine how the variables are related and how to compute $k$.


## Calculating distance from a Speed-time Graph
To calculate the **distance** traveled from a **speed-time graph**, the key is to recognize that the area under the graph represents the distance. 
Depending on the shape of the graph, different methods are used to find this area.

---

### General Formula:
The relationship is:

$`\text{} = \text{Area under the speed-time graph}`$

The graph's shape determines how to calculate the area. Here are common scenarios:

---

### 1. **Constant Speed (Rectangle)**:
If the speed is constant, the graph is a horizontal line.

**Formula**:

$`\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}`$

**Example**:
A car travels at 60 m/s for 10 seconds. Find the distance.


$`\text{Distance} = 60 \times 10 = 600 \, \text{m}`$

---

### 2. **Uniform Acceleration (Triangle)**:
If the speed increases uniformly from 0, the graph forms a right triangle.

**Formula**:

$`\text{Distance} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}`$

where:
- Base = time interval,
- Height = maximum speed.

**Example**:
A car accelerates from 0 to 20 m/s over 5 seconds. Find the distance.


$`\text{Distance} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 20 = 50 \, \text{m}`$

---

### 3. **Variable Speed (Trapezium)**:
If the speed increases or decreases linearly, the graph forms a trapezium.

**Formula**:

$`\text{Distance} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Sum of Parallel Sides}) \times \text{Height}`$

where:
- Parallel sides = initial and final speeds,
- Height = time interval.

**Example**:
A car accelerates from 10 m/s to 30 m/s over 4 seconds. Find the distance.


$`\text{Distance} = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 + 30) \times 4 = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \times 4 = 80 \, \text{m}`$

---

### 4. **Irregular Graph (Non-Linear)**:
For a speed-time graph with a non-linear shape, divide the graph into smaller sections (triangles, rectangles, trapeziums), 
calculate the area of each section, and sum them up.

**Example**:
If the graph is irregular, divide it into manageable segments like:
- A rectangle $`(\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1)`$,
- A triangle $`(\text{Distance}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height})`$.

Add the areas:

$`\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 + \dots`$

---

### Key Points:
1. The area under the curve in a speed-time graph always represents the total distance.
2. Use integration to calculate distance for a continuous, curved graph:
   
   $`\text{Distance} = \int v(t) \, dt`$

   where $`v(t)`$ is the speed as a function of time.
3. Units of distance depend on the units of speed and time.



## Modeling with Inverse Variation
**Modeling with Inverse Variation** involves describing a relationship where one variable increases as the other decreases, and their product remains constant. 
This relationship is mathematically expressed as:

$`y = \frac{k}{x}`$

Where:
- $y$: Dependent variable,
- $x$: Independent variable,
- $k$: Constant of variation $(k > 0)$.

---

### Key Characteristics of Inverse Variation
1. **Hyperbolic Relationship**:
   The graph of $`y = \frac{k}{x}`$ forms a hyperbola with two branches (one in the first quadrant and one in the third for positive $k$).

2. **Constant Product**:
   For all $x$ and $y$:
   
   $`x \cdot y = k`$

3. **No $x = 0$**:
   Since division by zero is undefined, $x = 0$ is not in the domain.

---

### Steps for Modeling Inverse Variation

1. **Identify the Relationship**:
   Verify that $x \cdot y$ is constant for a set of values. If so, it is an inverse variation.

2. **Find the Constant $k$**:
   Use known values of $x$ and $y$ to compute $k$:
   
   $`k = x \cdot y`$


3. **Write the Model**:
   Substitute $k$ into the inverse variation formula:
   
   $`y = \frac{k}{x}`$


4. **Predict or Solve**:
   Use the equation to predict $y$ for a given $x$, or vice versa.

---

### Example Problems

#### 1. **Basic Inverse Variation**
**Problem**: If $y = 8$ when $x = 5$, find the equation of the relationship.

**Solution**:
1. Compute $k$:
   
   $`k = x \cdot y = 5 \cdot 8 = 40`$

2. Write the equation:
   
   $`y = \frac{40}{x}`$


#### 2. **Predicting Values**
**Problem**: Using the model $`y = \frac{40}{x}`$, find $y$ when $x = 10$.

**Solution**:
Substitute $x = 10$:

$`y = \frac{40}{10} = 4`$

---

#### 3. **Real-World Example**
**Problem**: The time $t$ to complete a task varies inversely with the number of workers $w$. 
If 4 workers complete a task in 6 hours, how long will it take 8 workers?

**Solution**:
1. Use the inverse variation formula:
   
   $`t = \frac{k}{w}`$

2. Find $k$ using $w = 4, t = 6$:
   
   $`k = t \cdot w = 6 \cdot 4 = 24`$

3. Write the model:
   
   $`t = \frac{24}{w}`$

4. Find $t$ for $w = 8$:
   
   $`t = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \, \text{hours}`$

---

### Graphical Representation
- The graph of $`y = \frac{k}{x}`$ approaches the axes but never touches them $`(x \neq 0, y \neq 0)`$.
- The curve gets closer to the x-axis as $x$ increases and closer to the y-axis as $x$ decreases.

---

### Applications of Inverse Variation
1. **Physics**:
   - Intensity of light inversely varies with the square of the distance $`(I = \frac{k}{r^2})`$.
2. **Economics**:
   - Price per item varies inversely with the number of items purchased.
3. **Work Problems**:
   - Time to complete a task varies inversely with the number of workers. 

Inverse variation models are essential in many real-world scenarios involving trade-offs and proportional adjustments.



## Inverse Square Laws
The **Inverse Square Law** describes a relationship where a physical quantity's intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from its source. 
It applies to phenomena like gravity, light, sound, and electromagnetism. The general form is:


$`I = \frac{k}{r^2}`$

Where:
- $I$: Intensity of the physical quantity (e.g., brightness, gravitational force).
- $k$: Proportionality constant, dependent on the source and system.
- $r$: Distance from the source.

---

### Key Features of the Inverse Square Law:
1. **Intensity Decreases Rapidly**:
   As the distance $(r)$ increases, the intensity $(I)$ decreases proportionally to $`1/r^2`$.
   
2. **Spread Over an Area**:
   The law reflects how a quantity spreads over the surface of a sphere as the distance increases. The surface area of a sphere is $`4\pi r^2`$, 
   causing the intensity to decrease with $r^2$.

3. **Universal Application**:
   Many physical systems adhere to this principle due to the geometric nature of spreading in three-dimensional space.

---

### Examples of Inverse Square Laws:

#### 1. **Light Intensity**:
The brightness of light decreases as you move away from the source:

$`I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}`$

Where:
- $P$: Power of the light source (in watts),
- $r$: Distance from the source.

**Example**:
If a light source emits 100 W and you measure the intensity at 2 m:

$`I = \frac{100}{4\pi (2)^2} = \frac{100}{16\pi} \approx 1.99 \, \text{W/m}^2`$

---

#### 2. **Gravitational Force**:
Newton's Law of Gravitation states:

$`F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}`$

Where:
- $F$: Gravitational force,
- $G$: Gravitational constant $`(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2)`$,
- $`m_1, m_2`$: Masses of the objects,
- $r$: Distance between the masses.


**Example**:
If two masses of 10 kg each are separated by 2 m:

$`F = \frac{6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 10 \cdot 10}{2^2} = 1.67 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{N}`$

---

#### 3. **Sound Intensity**:
Sound spreads out spherically from its source:

$`I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}`$

Where:
- $P$: Power of the sound source,
- $r$: Distance from the source.

**Example**:
If a speaker emits 50 W of sound at 3 m:

$`I = \frac{50}{4\pi (3)^2} = \frac{50}{36\pi} \approx 0.44 \, \text{W/m}^2`$

---

#### 4. **Electric Field Intensity**:
The strength of an electric field generated by a point charge:

$`E = \frac{k_e q}{r^2}`$

Where:
- $E$: Electric field strength,
- $k_e$: Coulomb constant $`(8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2)`$,
- $q$: Charge,
- $r$: Distance from the charge.

---

### Visual Representation:
The inverse square relationship can be visualized with concentric spheres:
- As $r$ increases, the same quantity is spread over a larger area $`(4\pi r^2)`$.
- The graph of $I$ vs. $r$ is hyperbolic, showing steep decreases at small distances and gradual decreases at larger distances.

---

### Applications of Inverse Square Law:
1. **Physics**: Gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces.
2. **Astronomy**: Brightness of stars.
3. **Acoustics**: Sound intensity.
4. **Radiation**: Intensity of emitted particles or waves.

Understanding inverse square laws is crucial for analyzing phenomena that spread outward uniformly from a central source.


## Difference of Square Formula
The **Difference of Squares Formula** is a fundamental algebraic identity that allows the factorization of 
expressions involving the difference between two squared terms. The formula is:

$`a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)`$

Where:
- $a^2$ and $b^2$ are perfect squares,
- $(a + b)$ and $(a - b)$ are the factors.

---

### Why It Works:
The formula comes from the distributive property (expansion of $`(a + b)(a - b)`$):

$`(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - ab + ab - b^2 = a^2 - b^2`$

---

### Applications of the Difference of Squares Formula:

#### 1. **Factoring Expressions**:
If an expression is in the form $`a^2 - b^2`$, it can be quickly factored.

**Example**:

$`x^2 - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)`$

#### 2. **Simplifying Calculations**:
The formula simplifies computations of large numbers by expressing them as a difference of squares.

**Example**:
Calculate $`102^2 - 98^2`$:

$`102^2 - 98^2 = (102 + 98)(102 - 98) = 200 \cdot 4 = 800`$

#### 3. **Solving Quadratic Equations**:
The formula is used to solve equations of the form $`a^2 - b^2 = 0`$.

**Example**:
Solve $`x^2 - 16 = 0`$:

$`x^2 - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4) = 0`$


$`x + 4 = 0 \, \text{or} \, x - 4 = 0 \implies x = -4, 4`$

#### 4. **Geometric Applications**:
In geometry, the difference of squares formula can simplify problems involving areas, such as finding the 
difference between two square areas.

---

### Recognizing a Difference of Squares:
An expression is a difference of squares if:
1. Both terms are perfect squares (e.g., $`x^2, 9, 4y^2`$).
2. There is a subtraction sign $(-)$ between the terms.

**Examples**:
- $`4x^2 - 25 = (2x + 5)(2x - 5)`$,
- $`49 - y^2 = (7 + y)(7 - y)`$.

---

### Generalizations:
The difference of squares formula can also be extended to higher dimensions or applied with variables:
- For polynomials: $`x^4 - y^4 = (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 - y^2)`$,
- For expressions with binomials: $`(p + q)^2 - (r + s)^2 = [(p + q) + (r + s)][(p + q) - (r + s)]`$.

The difference of squares formula is a versatile tool for simplifying and solving algebraic expressions efficiently.


## 45, 45, 90 degrees triangles
A **45-45-90 triangle** is a special type of right triangle that has two 45-degree angles and one 90-degree angle. 
This type of triangle is **isosceles**, meaning the two legs are of equal length.

---

### Key Properties:
1. **Angle Measures**:
   - Two angles of $`45^\circ`$,
   - One right angle $`(90^\circ)`$.

2. **Sides' Relationship**:
   If the length of each leg is $x$, the hypotenuse is:
   
   $`\text{Hypotenuse} = x\sqrt{2}`$

   This results from the **Pythagorean Theorem**:
   
   $`x^2 + x^2 = (\text{Hypotenuse})^2`$

   
   $`2x^2 = (\text{Hypotenuse})^2 \implies \text{Hypotenuse} = x\sqrt{2}`$


3. **Ratios of the Sides**:
   - Leg : Leg : Hypotenuse = $`1 : 1 : \sqrt{2}`$.

---

### Example Problems:

#### **1. Find the Hypotenuse**
**Problem**: A 45-45-90 triangle has legs of length $5$. Find the hypotenuse.

**Solution**:
Use the relationship:

$`\text{Hypotenuse} = x\sqrt{2} = 5\sqrt{2}`$

#### **2. Find the Leg Length**
**Problem**: The hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 triangle is $12$. Find the length of each leg.

**Solution**:
Use the relationship:

$`\text{Hypotenuse} = x\sqrt{2}`$


$`12 = x\sqrt{2} \implies x = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} = 6\sqrt{2} \, \text{(simplified as rationalized form)}.`$

#### **3. Real-World Example**
**Problem**: A square has a diagonal of $10$. Find the side length of the square.

**Solution**:
The diagonal of a square divides it into two 45-45-90 triangles. Using the hypotenuse relationship:

$`\text{Diagonal} = x\sqrt{2}`$


$`10 = x\sqrt{2} \implies x = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5\sqrt{2}`$

Thus, the side length of the square is $`5\sqrt{2}`$.

---

### Applications:
1. **Geometry**:
   - Diagonals of squares.
   - Simplifying trigonometric problems.

2. **Trigonometry**:
   - Relationships: $`\sin(45^\circ) = \cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}`$.

3. **Engineering and Design**:
   - Constructing isosceles right triangles for structures or patterns.

The symmetry and simple side ratios make 45-45-90 triangles a cornerstone of geometry and trigonometry.


## Systems of linear equations with factorial coefficients
**Systems of linear equations with factorial coefficients** involve solving equations where the coefficients 
are factorials. Factorials, denoted by $n!$, represent the product of all positive integers up to $n$: 


$`n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdots 1, \quad \text{and by convention, } 0! = 1.`$

These systems can be solved using substitution, elimination, or matrix methods like Gaussian elimination. 
However, the presence of factorial coefficients requires careful simplifications due to their rapid growth.

---

### Example: Solving a System with Factorial Coefficients
Solve:

$`2!x + 3!y = 14 \tag{1}`$


$`4!x - 2!y = 44 \tag{2}`$

#### Step 1: Simplify Factorial Terms

$`2! = 2, \quad 3! = 6, \quad 4! = 24`$

Substitute these values into the equations:

$`2x + 6y = 14 \tag{3}`$


$`24x - 2y = 44 \tag{4}`$

#### Step 2: Eliminate One Variable
From Equation (3), divide through by 2 to simplify:

$`x + 3y = 7 \tag{5}`$

From Equation (4):

$`24x - 2y = 44 \implies 12x - y = 22 \tag{6}`$

Multiply Equation (5) by 2:

$`2x + 6y = 14 \tag{7}`$

#### Step 3: Solve the System
From Equations (6) and (7), use elimination or substitution:

$`12x - y = 22 \quad \text{(6)}`$


$`2x + 6y = 14 \quad \text{(7)}`$

Multiply Equation (6) by 6 to align $y$:

$`72x - 6y = 132 \tag{8}`$

Add Equations (7) and (8):

$`(72x - 6y) + (2x + 6y) = 132 + 14`$


$`74x = 146 \implies x = \frac{146}{74} = 2`$

#### Step 4: Solve for $y$
Substitute $x = 2$ into Equation (5):

$`2 + 3y = 7 \implies 3y = 5 \implies y = \frac{5}{3}`$

---

### Final Solution:

$`x = 2, \quad y = \frac{5}{3}`$

---

### General Tips for Solving Systems with Factorials:
1. **Simplify Factorials**: Replace $n!$ with numerical values to simplify the equations.
2. **Choose Methods Wisely**: Use substitution or elimination after simplifying factorial coefficients.
3. **Check for Special Cases**: Factorial growth can lead to unique scenarios or large coefficients that may require numerical methods for verification.
4. **Validate the Solution**: Always substitute the values back into the original system to ensure correctness.

Factorial systems, though rare, are excellent for testing problem-solving techniques and handling rapid-growth terms systematically.


## Systems of Equations with No Solutions and Infinitely Many Solutions
**Systems of equations** can have **no solution**, **one solution**, or **infinitely many solutions**. Here's how to identify and understand the cases where there are no solutions or infinitely many solutions.

---

### 1. **No Solution**: Inconsistent Systems
A system has no solution when the equations represent parallel lines that never intersect.

#### Conditions:
- The slopes of the equations are the same (parallel lines),
- The $y$-intercepts (or constants) are different.

#### Example:

$`y = 2x + 3 \tag{1}`$

$`y = 2x - 4 \tag{2}`$

- Both equations have a slope of $2$, so the lines are parallel.
- Different $y$-intercepts $(3)$ and $(-4)$ mean they never meet.

**Conclusion**: The system is inconsistent, and there is **no solution**.

---

### 2. **Infinitely Many Solutions**: Dependent Systems
A system has infinitely many solutions when the equations represent the same line.

#### Conditions:
- The equations are proportional (one equation can be obtained by multiplying or dividing the other by a constant).

#### Example:

$`2x + y = 6 \tag{1}`$


$`4x + 2y = 12 \tag{2}`$

- Dividing the second equation by $2$:

$`2x + y = 6`$

- The two equations are identical, so they represent the same line.

**Conclusion**: The system is dependent, and there are **infinitely many solutions**.

---

### General Procedure to Identify the Solution Type:

1. **Write equations in slope-intercept form $`(y = mx + b)`$**:
   - Compare slopes $(m)$:
     - If slopes are different: One solution (lines intersect).
     - If slopes are the same:
       - Compare $y$-intercepts $(b)$:
         - Different $b$: No solution (parallel lines).
         - Same $b$: Infinitely many solutions (same line).

2. **Use the elimination method**:
   - Combine equations to eliminate one variable.
   - If a false statement results (e.g., $0 = 5$): No solution.
   - If a true statement results (e.g., $0 = 0$): Infinitely many solutions.

---

### Example: Analyze a System


$`x + y = 4 \tag{1}`$


$`2x + 2y = 8 \tag{2}`$


#### Step 1: Simplify the equations
Divide Equation $(2)$ by $2$:

$`x + y = 4 \tag{3}`$

Equations (1) and (3) are identical, so the system represents the same line.

**Conclusion**: Infinitely many solutions.

---

### Key Points to Remember:

- **No Solution**: Parallel lines $`(m_1 = m_2), (b_1 \neq b_2)`$.
- **Infinitely Many Solutions**: Identical lines $`(m_1 = m_2), (b_1 = b_2)`$.
- **Test using substitution or elimination**: Check for contradictions or identities.


## piecewise function
A **piecewise function** is a function that is defined by different expressions or formulas over different
parts of its domain. It is useful for modeling situations where the behavior of the function changes depending 
on the input.

---

### **Definition**
A piecewise function $f(x)$ is expressed as:

$`f(x) = \begin{cases} f_1(x) & \text{if } x \in D_1 \\ f_2(x) & \text{if } x \in D_2 \\ \vdots \\ f_n(x) & \text{if } x \in D_n  \end{cases}`$

where:
- $`f_1(x), f_2(x), \dots, f_n(x)`$ are the individual expressions (rules),
- $`D_1, D_2, \dots, D_n`$ are the corresponding domains (intervals or subsets of the input domain).

---

### **Example 1: Absolute Value Function**
The absolute value function is a classic example of a piecewise function:

$`f(x) = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0  \end{cases}`$

#### Explanation:
- If $`x \geq 0`$, the function outputs $x$ (positive).
- If $`x < 0`$, the function outputs $-x$ (its positive counterpart).

---

### **Example 2: Tax Rate**
A tax function based on income might be defined as:

$`T(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } x \leq 10000 \\ 0.1x & \text{if } 10000 < x \leq 50000 \\ 0.2x - 4000 & \text{if } x > 50000  \end{cases}`$

#### Explanation:
- No tax for incomes up to $10,000.
- A 10% tax rate for incomes between $10,000 and $50,000.
- A higher tax rate (with adjustment) for incomes above $50,000.

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Continuity**: A piecewise function can be continuous if there are no abrupt "jumps" between the pieces, i.e., 
     the boundaries of the domains match the outputs.
   - Example: $`\sin(x)`$ defined differently over periodic intervals.
2. **Discontinuity**: If the outputs do not match at the domain boundaries, the function is discontinuous.
   - Example: A step function like the Heaviside function.

---

### **Graphing Piecewise Functions**
1. Break the domain into intervals based on the rules.
2. Plot each rule within its corresponding domain.
3. Use open or closed circles to indicate whether endpoints are included.

---

### **Applications**
1. **Physics**: Modeling systems with different behaviors in different ranges (e.g., material stress-strain curves).
2. **Economics**: Representing tax brackets, discounts, or tiered pricing.
3. **Computer Science**: Decision-making processes or algorithms with multiple conditions.

Piecewise functions provide flexibility to model complex systems in mathematics and real-world applications.




## **Absolute Value Graphs**

The graph of an absolute value function is shaped like a "V" and represents the absolute value of a variable 
or expression. These graphs have distinct features, including a vertex and symmetry.

### **Definition**

The absolute value function is given by:

$`f(x) = |x| = \begin{cases}  x & \text{if } x \geq 0, \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0.  \end{cases}`$

---

### **Key Features of the Basic Graph $`f(x) = |x|`$**

1. **Shape**: The graph is a "V" that opens upwards.
2. **Vertex**: The lowest point is at the origin $(0, 0)$.
3. **Symmetry**: The graph is symmetric about the $y$-axis.
4. **Domain**: The domain is all real numbers, $`\mathbb{R}`$.
5. **Range**: The range is $`[0, \infty)`$, as absolute values are non-negative.

---

### **Transformations**

Absolute value graphs can be transformed using changes to the equation:

1. **Vertical Shift**: 
   
   $`f(x) = |x| + c`$

   - Shifts the graph **up** by $c$ if $c > 0$, or **down** by $c < 0$.

2. **Horizontal Shift**:
   
   $`f(x) = |x - h|`$

   - Shifts the graph **right** by $h > 0$ or **left** by $h < 0$.

3. **Vertical Stretch/Compression**:
   
   $`f(x) = a|x|`$

   - Stretches the graph if $|a| > 1$.
   - Compresses the graph if $`0 < |a| < 1`$.
   - Flips the graph upside down if $a < 0$.

4. **Horizontal Stretch/Compression**:
   
   $`f(x) = |bx|`$

   - Compresses horizontally if $`|b| > 1`$.
   - Stretches horizontally if $`0 < |b| < 1`$.

5. **Combined Transformations**:
   For $`f(x) = a|x - h| + k`$:
   - $h$: Horizontal shift.
   - $k$: Vertical shift.
   - $a$: Stretch, compression, or reflection.

### **Example 1: Simple Transformation**
Graph $`f(x) = |x - 2| + 3`$:
- Shifts the basic $`f(x) = |x|`$ graph **right by 2** and **up by 3**.
- Vertex is at $(2, 3)$.

---

### **Example 2: Reflection and Stretch**
Graph $`f(x) = -2|x| + 4`$:
- Reflects the graph **downward** because of the negative sign.
- Stretches vertically by a factor of 2.
- Shifts **up by 4**.

---

### **Applications**
1. **Distance**: Absolute value graphs can model real-world distances, as distance is always non-negative.
2. **Optimization**: In economics and engineering, absolute values are used to minimize deviations or errors.
3. **Piecewise Representation**: Absolute value graphs are often analyzed as piecewise functions for advanced computations.

These graphs visually represent how absolute values behave and their transformations can model various 
real-world scenarios.




## **Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes**

Asymptotes are lines that a graph approaches but never touches or crosses (in most cases) as $x$ or $y$
moves toward infinity or a specific value. Vertical and horizontal asymptotes describe the long-term behavior 
or boundary limits of a function.

---

### **Vertical Asymptotes**

#### **Definition**:
A vertical asymptote occurs when a function approaches infinity $`(\infty)`$ or negative infinity $`(-\infty)`$ 
as the input $x$ approaches a specific value $x = a$.

#### **Mathematical Expression**:
For a function $f(x)$:

$`\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \infty \quad \text{or} \quad \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \infty,`$

or vice versa with $-\infty$.

#### **How to Find Vertical Asymptotes**:
1. **Rational Functions**:
   - For $`f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}`$, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator $`Q(x) = 0`$ and the 
     numerator $P(x)$ is nonzero.
   - Example: For $`f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 2}`$, the vertical asymptote is $x = 2$ because the denominator becomes zero when \(x = 2\).

2. **Logarithmic Functions**:
   - For $`f(x) = \ln(x)`$, the vertical asymptote is $x = 0$, since the natural logarithm is undefined 
     for $`x \leq 0`$.

---

### **Horizontal Asymptotes**

#### **Definition**:
A horizontal asymptote occurs when a function approaches a specific constant value $`y = b`$ as $x$
moves toward infinity $(\infty)$ or negative infinity $(-\infty)$.

#### **Mathematical Expression**:
For a function $f(x)$:

$`\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = b \quad \text{or} \quad \lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = b.`$

#### **How to Find Horizontal Asymptotes**:
1. **Rational Functions**:
   - For $`f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}`$, compare the degrees of the numerator $`(P(x))`$ and denominator $`(Q(x))`$:
     - **Degree of $(P(x)$ < Degree of $Q(x)$**: Horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$.
     - **Degree of $P(x)$ = Degree of $Q(x)$**: Horizontal asymptote at $`y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)}`$.
     - **Degree of $P(x)$ > Degree of $Q(x)$**: No horizontal asymptote; the function diverges.

2. **Exponential Functions**:
   - For $`f(x) = e^{-x}`$, as $`x \to \infty`$, $f(x) \to 0$, so the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$.

---

### **Graphical Interpretation**
- **Vertical Asymptotes**: The graph rises or falls steeply near $x = a$.
- **Horizontal Asymptotes**: The graph levels off to a constant value as $x$ moves far left or right.

---

### **Examples**
1. **Rational Function**: $`f(x) = \frac{2x + 3}{x - 1}`$
   - Vertical asymptote: $x = 1$ (denominator is zero at $x = 1$).
   - Horizontal asymptote: $y = 2$ (degrees of numerator and denominator are equal; 
     ratio of leading coefficients is $`\frac{2}{1}`$).

2. **Exponential Decay**: $`f(x) = 5e^{-x}`$
   - No vertical asymptote.
   - Horizontal asymptote: $y = 0$ as $`x \to \infty`$.

---

### **Applications**
1. **Physics**: Modeling phenomena like gravitational forces or electric fields, which approach zero but never reach it.
2. **Economics**: Long-term trends in supply and demand or cost functions.
3. **Biology**: Population growth models with carrying capacity.

Understanding vertical and horizontal asymptotes helps analyze the behavior of functions in both theoretical and 
applied contexts.
