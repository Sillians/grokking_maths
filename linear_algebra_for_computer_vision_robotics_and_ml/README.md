Many books on machine learning struggle with a concise explanation of the tools for machine learning, computer vision, 
and so on, one needs to have a firm background in linear algebra, optimization theory, and statistics. How can one 
understand what are the dual variables of a ridge regression problem if one doesnâ€™t know about the Lagrangian duality 
framework? Similarly, how is it possible to discuss the dual formulation of SVM without a firm understanding of 
the Lagrangian framework?

The easy way out is to sweep these difficulties under the rug. If one is just a consumer of the techniques mentioned above.

My main goal here is to study and learn the core fundamentals of linear algebra and optimization theory, keeping in 
mind applications to machine learning, robotics, and computer vision.
