## Mathematical Foundations I






### The isosceles Triangle Theorem
Remember that longer sides in a triangle are opposite to larger angles, and vice versa. But what if two (or more) sides have the same length?

As you might have guessed, if two sides have the same length, then the opposite angles have the same measure. And vice-versa: if two angles have the same measure, then the opposite sides have the same length.

So, we obtain the following important properties of isosceles and equilateral triangles:

- A triangle is equilateral if and only if all of its angles are of $60^o$.
- A triangle is isosceles if and only if it has exactly two congruent angles.

The isosceles triangle theorem:
- If a triangle is isosceles, then the base angles are congruent.

The converse isosceles triangle theorem:
- If two angles in a triangle have the same measure, then the triangle must be isosceles.

The internal angles of any triangle sum to $180^o$


### Introduction to Elimination Method

`Systems of Linear Equation`
The elimination method is one of the techniques to solve the system of linear equations. In this method, either add or subtract the equations to get the equation in one variable. If the coefficients of one of the variables are the same, and the sign of the coefficients are opposite, we can add the equation to eliminate the variable. Similarly, if the coefficients of one of the variables are the same, and the sign of the coefficients are the same, we can subtract the equation to get the equation in one variable.

In case, if we do not have the equation to directly add or subtract the equations to eliminate the variable, you can begin by multiplying one or both the equations by a constant value on both sides of an equation to obtain the equivalent linear system of equations and then eliminate the variable by simply adding or subtracting equations.

`Elimination Method Steps:`

- **Step 1**: Firstly, multiply both the given equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make the coefficients of any one of the variables (either x or y) numerically equal.

- **Step 2**: After that, add or subtract one equation from the other in such a way that one variable gets eliminated. 
Now, if you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3. Else;

If we obtain a true statement including no variable, then the original pair of equations has infinitely many solutions.
If we obtain a false statement including no variable, then the original pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent.

- **Step 3**: Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) to get its value.

- **Step 4**: Substitute this value in any of the given equations to get the value of another variable


### Introduction to Functions

A function is a rule that takes a number as input and then outputs another number. A function is defined as a relation between a set of inputs having one output each. In simple words, a function is a relationship between inputs where each input is related to exactly one output. Every function has a domain and codomain or range. 
A function is generally denoted by $f(x)$ where $x$ is the input.

For instance, let's look at the following function:

$`f(x) = 3x + 1`$

In this example,

- $f$ is the name of the function,
- the number $x$ is the input,
- the number $`3x + 1`$ is the output.



### Equations of Lines in Slope Intercept

The slope intercept formula $`y = mx + b`$ is used when you know the slope of the line to be examined and the point given is also the $y$ intercept (0, b). 
In the formula, $b$ represents the $y$ value of the $y$ intercept point.

To determine the equation of a line, you may use two variations of the general form of a line.

These formulas are:

- The Point-Slope Formula:  $`(y – y_{1}) = m(x – x_{1})`$

- we calculate the slope $m$ using the given points: $`m = \frac {(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - X_1)}`$

- The Slope-Intercept Formula: $`y = mx + b`$


### Congruent Polygons
Two polygons are congruent if they have the same shape. This means that

- they have the same number of sides,
- all corresponding sides are congruent, and
- all corresponding interior angles are congruent.


### Rules of Absolute Value
Absolute value represents the distance of a number from 0 on the number line, regardless of direction. It is always non-negative.

#### **Notation**
The absolute value of $x$ is written as $`|x|`$.

#### **Rules for Computation**
1. **If $`x \geq 0`$:**
   
   $`|x| = x`$

2. **If $x < 0$:**
   
   $`|x| = -x`$

   (The negative sign makes it positive.)

---

#### **Examples**
1. $|5| = 5$ (positive remains unchanged).
2. $|-3| = 3$ (negative becomes positive).
3. $|0| = 0$ (zero is its own absolute value).


#### **Properties of Absolute Value**
1. **Non-Negativity:** $`|x| \geq 0`$.
2. **Identity Property:** $`|x| = 0`$ if and only if $x = 0$.
3. **Multiplicative Property:** $`|ab| = |a| \cdot |b|`$.
4. **Triangle Inequality:** $`|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|`$.


#### **Applications**
1. **Solving Absolute Value Equations:**
   - Example: Solve $`|x - 2| = 5`$.
     - Case 1: $`x - 2 = 5`$ → $x = 7$.
     - Case 2: $`x - 2 = -5`$ → $x = -3$.

2. **Solving Absolute Value Inequalities:**
   - Example: Solve $`|x - 3| \leq 4`$.
     - Rewrite as $`-4 \leq x - 3 \leq 4`$.
     - Solve: $`-1 \leq x \leq 7`$.
